# MediScan-AI-Enhancing-Lung-Cancer-Detection-with-Advanced-DL-ML

Project Overview:

MediScan-AI aims to revolutionize lung cancer detection by leveraging advanced Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective is to achieve precise classification of nodules, distinguishing between benign and malignant entities. The project prioritizes efficiency and speed beyond traditional methods.

Key Features:

Simple CNN Model:
        Initial implementation involves a foundational Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the baseline model.

Overfitting Mitigation:
        Implemented measures to address overfitting, including batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation, ensuring robust performance and handling data imbalances effectively.

Pretrained Models Experimentation:
        Explored the use of advanced pretrained models, such as VGG19, ResNet50, and MobileNet, to enhance efficiency and leverage the power of transfer learning.

Performance Evaluation:
        Conducted a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of each model's performance, aiming to determine the most suitable model for the lung cancer detection task.
